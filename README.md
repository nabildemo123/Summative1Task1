# Technical Documentation 

## Overview

This program is a Python terminal-based game that tests users' math skills. It includes five multiplication questions, with an additional bonus division question if the user scores a 5/5. The program is split into two files for modularity: one for the main logic `main.py` and another for the required functions `functions.py`.

---

## Code Structure

The program is structured in two files:

1. **`main.py`:**
   - Contains the primary game logic.
   - Handles the user interface in the terminal.
   - Manages scoring and bonus question logic.
   - imports functions needed.

2. **`functions.py`:**
   - reusable functions for generating questions and validating user input.

---

## `functions.py`

This file contains three functions:

### **1. `question()`**
- **Purpose:** Generates a random multiplication question.
- **Returns:** A tuple of two integers (`num_1`, `num_2`) and their product (`answer`).
- **Example Usage:**
  ```
  num_1, num_2, answer = question()
  print(f"{num_1} Ã— x = {answer}")
  ```
### **2. `bonus_question()`**
- **Purpose:** Generates a random divison question.
- **Returns:** A tuple of two integers (`num_1`, `num_2`) and their quotient (`answer`).
- **Example Usage:**
  ```
  num_1, num_2, answer = bonus_question()
  print(f"{num_1} / y = {answer}")
  ```
  
### **3. `get_valid_input(prompt)`**
- **Purpose:** Ensures that the user inputs a valid integer.
- **Parameters:**
  - `prompt (str)`: The message displayed to the user.
- **Returns:** A valid integer.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```
  user_input = get_valid_input("What is the value of x?: ")
  ```

  
---
  ## `mains.py`

this is the file that should be run the game.

 **Initialize Score:**  
   The program starts by initializing the score to `0`.

2. **Generate Multiplication Questions:**  
   A loop iterates five times, calling the `question()` function from `functions.py`. The user is prompted to solve each question, and their score is updated for correct answers, 

3. **Display Final Score:**  
   After all five questions, the program displays the userâ€™s total score.

4. **Bonus Question:**  
   If the user scores 5/5, a bonus question pops up: a division question generated by the `bonus_question()` function. Feedback is provided based on their response.if the user inputs 1 the question will be sent if not the quiz ends.

5. **Exit Logic:**  
   The program exits after the quiz or bonus round.
